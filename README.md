# Backend

SpringBoot is set to run in this repository on Java 21. Please install Java 21 or a newer version, and be sure to have your JAVA_HOME variable set correctly.

To run the backend, cd into the backend directory, and run `./gradlew bootRun`

After starting up the JVM, you should be able to see "Hello World!" printed on your screen at http://localhost:8080/hello

When you're done running the JVM to test the application, be sure to run `./gradlew --stop` in the same directory to avoid leaving any daemon(s) uneccesarily
